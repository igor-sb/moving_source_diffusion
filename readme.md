# Diffusion from a moving source

_(this was a side project I did during my PhD)_

Many living cells eat and digest other living cells. One example is shown in the
video below taken from a 16 mm movie made in 1950s by the late prof. David Rogers
at Vanderbilt University. Here a white blood cell (largest thing moving around) is crawling among red blood cells (circular objects) and chasing a _Staphylococcus aureus_ "Staph" bacteria (little black dumbbell looking thing). Bacteria secretes chemicals which white blood cells can sense and use as a tracer to find and kill bacteria.

I was curious what is the best possible accuracy with which cells (such as white blood cells) can track chemical gradients generated by other cells under these dynamical conditions. This seems challenging since the detection of chemical signals is very noisy and that chemicals also diffuse and spread in the environment. To put it into perspective, if you manually introduce a small patch of chemical the size of bacteria in the video, in one second it would spread over the area of a white blood cell (~ 20 &mu;m by 10 &mu;m).

## Modeling: COMSOL Multiphysics / MATLAB

I simulated the bacteria as a point source

** MATLAB instructions **

* In the work I've done for this project so far, I only used MATLAB to generate a set of coordinates that we use to move the bacteria around. Looking back, better way would be to start "COMSOL with MATLAB", define a ``fem`` object and then do everything through MATLAB. 

** COMSOL Multiphysics (3.5) instructions **
* Create two geometries ('geom's). The first one is the main
domain where the diffusion is simulated (a square, insulating boundary, diffusion and no
  convection and reaction terms under ``Physics`` / ``Subdomain Settings``) and a second one consisting of a single point.
* Define two functions (``Options`` / ``Functions``): `xcoord` and `ycoord` which are going to be used to move the second geom (point) in the coordinate system of the first geom.
